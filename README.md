# OS-assignment

Just my OS assignments for transferring between my devices.

pa1.c - C file containing interprocess communication between main and child

output - stores output of pa1.c

d1 - directory 1; jurisdiction of child 1

d2 - directory 2; jurisdiction of child 2

d1.txt - list of files in directory 1

d2.txt - list of files in directory 2

## 4 THINGS TO BE DONE:

[X] Have each child create a list of names of the files in their assigned directory

[X] Have each child send the list to the other child using a pipe

[X] Have each child create missing files using the list received from the other child

[\_]Have each child send the contents of the files in its directory. The receiving child will populate files with received content.
